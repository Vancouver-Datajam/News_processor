Most of Linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. Linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency. Large customer contracts typically have escalation and pass-through clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs. Such attempts may not successfully mitigate cost variability, which could negatively impact Linde’s financial condition or results of operations. The supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where Linde conducts business. However, regional energy conditions are unpredictable and may pose future risk."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, 37 stores were significantly impacted by hurricanes, mostly in Puerto Rico, and were excluded from comp sales. These stores will be included in the comp sales measures once they again meet the comp sales criteria."

They will also enable an average decrease of 45% in the energy bill of our branches and contribute to the diversification of the renewable energy matrix in Brazil. When all the plants are in operation, 3,150 tons of carbon dioxide will no longer be emitted per year, which corresponds to the planting of about 21 thousand trees."

In some regions of the world, for example in West Africa south of the Sahara, raw materials for cement production are so scarce that cement or clinker needs to be imported by sea. Rising transportation costs and capacity constraints in the port facilities can lead to an increase in product costs. Overall, we rate this as a low risk."
0,risk,"In light of such events there has been a rise in climate-change activism epitomised by Greta Thunberg. We have also witnessed a plethora of pledges from both companies and politicians to tackle climate change, but real, decisive action supporting the pledges to reduce emissions has yet to surface. The uncomfortable truth is that our entire economy is based on fossil fuels, and therefore moving to a low-carbon future will affect all sectors. Furthermore, having emitted the bulk of the emissions to achieve economic growth and raise living standards, the West finds itself in the Janus-faced position of asking the developing world to reduce their emissions and perhaps by extension limit their ability to deliver growth and lift people out of poverty."
1,neural,"In 2017, I commissioned Newton’s first TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) report to ensure that we were holding ourselves to the same standards as our investee companies, and specifically to explain how we were considering, and preparing for, the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. Following the first report, I am delighted to introduce our second TCFD report which combines updates from 2018 and 2019, during which period we have made a number of positive changes. Highlights include establishing board-level oversight for Newton’s actions on climate-related risks, entering into new data relationships with carbon experts, undertaking significant internal education, and establishing a climate change-focused investment group to undertake climate scenario analysis."
0,risk,"Whilst the transition scenarios saw material impacts on the investment portfolio, the most notable impacts on both investments and insurance liabilities arose from the physical effects of no transition, that is no additional actions beyond those already announced. Based on the PRA specifications, Scenario C, in which physical risk dominates, resulted in the most significant impact on the Group but did not breach risk appetite despite not allowing for reinsurance. This demonstrates the resilience of the Group’s strategy to such a scenario. Furthermore, the projected time frame (2100) for this scenario is likely to allow the business to adapt. The share of transition versus physical risks by scenario is shown below."

In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and supply chain, and cause them to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. NRG's commercial and residential customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change and may incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these efforts, including increasing the mix and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply."
