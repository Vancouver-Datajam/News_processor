The process is based on production of a synthetic gas from carbon-based material.

Methanol produced using waste as a raw material could be considered as a Recycled Carbon Fuel, as provided for by the RED II European directive on renewable energy, and therefore assimilable to a biofuel. It can be used in petrols by transformation into MTBE, or mixed with experimental high alcohol content petrols together with bioethanol (A20 pet- rol).

The CMSI includes representatives from across the banking, insurance and investment sectors alongside pre-eminent Australian climate scientists working together under the auspices of the National Environmental Science Program's Earth Systems and Climate Change (ESCC) Hub, professional services firms and finance sector industry bodies. The objectives of the CMSI are to provide open- source voluntary guidelines for financial institutions (banks, insurers and asset managers and owners) with consistent scientific and technical guidance on how to assess the physical risk of climate-related damage to homes, buildings and other critical infrastructure arising from extreme weather events - such as tropical cyclones, bushfires and floods. The CMSI focused on supporting implementation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations in addition to better understanding the financial system's exposures to climate-related risks. Two key reports were published in the 2020 financial year, including a finance report and a science report which are available at: https://www.cmsi.org.au/reports - Climate-KIC Australia (Climate-KIC) - The Group has been working with Climate-KIC and a number of other organisations, including government agencies and industry bodies on an Adaptation Finance Project.

The Supervisory Board defined specific CO2 reduction as focus topic for the strategic and sustainability target for long-term variable remuneration (LTI) for the 2020 financial year. The non-financial performance criteria thus take the interests of key stakeholders into account and provide long-term incentives for the environmental goal of reducing specific carbon emissions. For the LTI, the possible range of the target achievement for the financial and non- financial targets is between 0% and 200%. For the non-financial target “Environment”, the targets set by IATA (International Air Transport Association) for fuel efficiency are used, i.e. the average amount of kerosene consumed to carry a passenger 100 kilometres. The aim is to reduce specific fuel consumption by 1.5% p.a. and so to improve specific CO2 emissions. The LTI for 2020 includes emissions from Lufthansa’s own fleet as well as those from wet lease flights. To calculate performance, the improvement in specific CO2 emissions is measured annually over the four-year performance period. This was the Further Disclosure only non-financial target for LTI in 2019 and 2020 and accounted for 25% of the LTI. Specific CO2 efficiency (including wet-lease flights) came to 10.52 kg/100 passenger-kilometres in 2020 (2019: 9.22 kg/100 passenger-kilometres), so that performance in the 2020 financial year for the environmental parameter for the LTI 2020 was 0%.

Specifically, reviewing and guiding strategy is scheduled into every board meeting to inform the entire board and contribute to managing information, making decisions about what the company will do, and adapting those decisions based on climate-related information.

Top-down reviews consist of one-on-one meetings with every member of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) as well as select group Area Vice Presidents to get a regional and operations-focused viewpoint on risk. Bottom-up reviews are done in workshop format including all subject matter experts for a given headline risk as well as participants from regional operations. An output from these meetings is a standardized scorecard which includes risk and opportunity ratings for (financial) impact, likelihood (of event), outlook (of risk exposure) and confidence (in risk management). Additionally, forward-looking action plans with measurable indicators and progress on action plans from previous assessments are also discussed & documented. Based on findings from top-down and bottom-up reviews, certain risks are identified as “Priority Risks” and receive a more granular assessment, quantification of impact, and are elevated for further discussion with the SLT and the Board.
