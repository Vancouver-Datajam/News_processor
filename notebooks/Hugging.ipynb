       "1319  Climate change is producing changes in weather and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, and thus may affect consumer demand for electricity. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and supply chain, and cause them to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. NRG's commercial and residential customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change and may incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these efforts, including increasing the mix and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply.   \n",

    "Logistic Regression Model Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the Logistic Regression model exhibited strong performance with a training accuracy of 95.45% and a validation accuracy of 77.27%. However, when applied to the sentiment analysis task with three levels (negative, neutral, positive), Logistic Regression struggled to achieve optimal results. This is because Logistic Regression is inherently designed for binary classification, making it less suitable for multi-class problems like ours. The model's performance dropped significantly after tuning, with a training accuracy of 67.33% and a validation accuracy of 61.36%. This decrease in accuracy suggests that despite efforts to reduce overfitting, Logistic Regression may not capture the nuances of multi-class sentiment analysis effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes Model Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite our best efforts, we encountered challenges with the Naive Bayes model. Even after extensive hyperparameter tuning, we faced overfitting issues, where the model performed exceptionally well on the training data but struggled to generalize to unseen validation data. Specifically, the Naive Bayes model achieved a high training accuracy of 87.88%, but its validation accuracy remained at a comparatively lower 70.83%. This suggests that the model may have become overly complex or that we need to explore further techniques to control overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM Model Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, with the SVM model, we encountered certain limitations. Although we performed hyperparameter tuning and obtained the best hyperparameters (C=20, gamma=0.1, kernel='rbf'), we still observed a slight performance gap between the training accuracy (100%) and the validation accuracy (79.17%). This discrepancy implies that, despite optimization efforts, there might be inherent limitations in the SVM's ability to generalize to unseen data. The SVM model excels at finding complex decision boundaries, but it may not fully capture the intricacies of sentiment analysis, especially in cases where the data exhibits high nonlinearity or complex relationships. Further strategies may be necessary to mitigate this performance gap and enhance model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, it may be beneficial to explore more advanced algorithms explicitly designed for multi-class sentiment analysis, such as gradient boosting methods (e.g., XGBoost) or deep learning approaches (e.g., neural networks with embeddings). "
